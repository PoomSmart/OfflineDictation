OfflineDictation
==========

Offline Dictation feature (possibly) for 64-bit devices (only).

CydiaSubstrate is already done, compile and try by yourself to see if this even works.

Alternatively, you may copy /User/Library/Assistant/SpeechProfile\_LANGUAGE\_CODE from iPhone 6s(+)/SE or iPad Pro and test on their own unsupported devices.

Supported iOS versions: apparently iOS 9.0+
